# Seva Kendra 

This is a Project created for TECHNORAX Hackathon in my college ADGITM.
It serves as a third-party middleman that facilitates quicker resolution of neighborhood problems.
Users have the option to report any problem in their immediate environment.
In the event that authorities don't respond to complaints, users can contact them.
